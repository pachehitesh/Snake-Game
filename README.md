# Snake-Game
## Welcome to Snake Game in Python!

This project presents a classic Snake game, developed using Python's Turtle module. Dive into the nostalgia as you control the snake's movement using arrow keys on your keyboard. The objective is to guide the snake to consume the green food scattered across the screen, which elongates its length. However, be cautious! Colliding with the walls or the snake's own body results in game over.

## Features:
- Intuitive arrow key controls for seamless gameplay.
- Dynamic food placement for varied challenges.
- Interactive graphics rendered using Turtle, offering a retro gaming experience.
- Game over detection ensures a challenging and engaging experience.
